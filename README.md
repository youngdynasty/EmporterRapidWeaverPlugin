# Emporter RapidWeaver Plugin

![Emporter RapidWeaver Plugin](https://emporter.app/graphics/emporter.rapidweaverplugin.jpg)

Share your [RapidWeaver](https://www.realmacsoftware.com/rapidweaver/) project's previews over HTTPS, instantly, _without_ publishing.

[Emporter](https://emporter.app) creates a secure URL to your Mac which can be shared anywhere. The plugin automatically configures Emporter so that its URL points to your RapidWeaver project's preview.

Use it to get help on the [RapidWeaver forum](https://forums.realmacsoftware.com/c/rapidweaver) or just to share your project's progress before it goes live.

It's never been easier to get real-time feedback!

## Installation

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/youngdynasty/EmporterRapidWeaverPlugin/releases/latest/download/Emporter.rapidweaverplugin.zip).
2. Unarchive and double-click to install.

Please note that this plugin only supports RapidWeaver 8.3+.

## Usage

Easy! Just add an Emporter page to your project.

Once your URL is live, it'll stay online until you delete the Emporter page, you close your project, or your Mac disconnects from the internet.
